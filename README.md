<p> This is a memory game created with the scope of having 
    fun when taking a break from working, learning, etc. The strategy was to create a 
    game for the user to relax in a toning way for the mind. Memory-games are known to
    both entertain and exercise the main functions of the brain at all ages.

    The chosen theme is Universum, specifically planets from our Solar System. 
    The reason behind this theme choice is the fact that the subject related to space 
    and time infinity usually doesn't trigger negative emotions for people, but on the
     contrary, it gives them a feeling of trust and relief and helps to disconnect from the 
     daily routine.
