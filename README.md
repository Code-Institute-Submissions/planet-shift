<p> This is a memory game created with the scope of having 
    fun when taking a break from working, learning, etc. The strategy was to create a 
    game for the user to relax in a toning way for the mind. Memory-games are known 
    for some positive effects they can have sometimes on brain functions like attention,
     concentration or visual recognition for people at all ages.
</p>
<p>
    The chosen theme is astro-space, specifically planets from our Solar System. 
    The reason behind this theme choice is the fact that the subject related to space 
    and time infinity usually doesn't trigger negative emotions for people, but on the
     contrary, it gives them a feeling of trust and relief and helps to disconnect from the 
     daily routine.

## Design
### Color Scheme
-   The colour palette for the game is gradient blue set vertically starting 
from top black/dark-blue going lighter towards the middle and going darker to dark-blue/black towards bottom.
### Typography
-   [Share Tech Mono](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Share+Tech+Mono?query=tec)  google font is the main font used throughout the whole text from the game.
### Imagery
-   Front face cards display images of different planets from our solar system on a square 
black backgound. The planets' bright colours stands out from their black background and this contrast 
allows the user easily grasp and retain the object from the card.
-   Back face cards display an unique image of space with lights on the background
### Music and Sounds
-   Background music is set at 50% volume so that the user can hear the game commands sounds 
(click on card, match cards, game over and victory)
-   The chosen sounds are also set at a confortable volume in order not to upset the User Experience
-   The chosen background music has a pleasant energizing tone and rythm.

5. The page will automatically refresh.
6. Scroll back down through the page to locate the now published site [link](https://github.com) in the "GitHub Pages" section.

### Forking the GitHub Repository

By forking the GitHub Repository we make a copy of the original repository on our GitHub account to view and/or make changes without affecting the original repository by using the following steps...

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/)
2. At the top of the Repository (not top of page) just above the "Settings" Button on the menu, locate the "Fork" Button.
3. You should now have a copy of the original repository in your GitHub account.

### Making a Local Clone

2. Under the repository name, click "Clone or download".
3. To clone the repository using HTTPS, under "Clone with HTTPS", copy the link.
4. Open Git Bash
5. Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory to be made.
6. Type `git clone`, and then paste the URL you copied in Step 3.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY
```

7. Press Enter. Your local clone will be created.

## Tutorials
<p>My personal scope of creating this memory game was learning how to juggle with javascript function
    and to better undestand the applicability of the powerfull tools that this intricate programming language
    has to offer. I have to admit that I have understood a big deal of logical javascript behaviour while 
    following these tutorials. They offered me big support during the creation of this project.</p>

-   I have taken inspiration as for the structure of the memory game [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28VfzEiJgy4)
-   I have followed the walkthrough tutorial for the game commands in javascript [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uuQ3g92oPQ&t=395s)
